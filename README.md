# LAN-NETWORK-WITH-REDUDANCY
A network which has redundancy in the design to to be setup for an organization.
The organization is currently having an internet connection, which is setup using a Cisco
router.
The gateway addresses for users in the LAN is currently provided as an intermediate
router
address, which would then forward all internet bound packets to the internet router.
The network has to be upgraded by having dual intermediate routers which would
automatically
failover, and provide high availability access to the internet. HSRP is to be used for the
deployment.
The project identifies the configurations required on Cisco routers to achieve the same.
● To implement LAN Network design with redundancy with HSRP.
● The organization’s network has to be upgraded by having dual intermediate
routers which would automatically failover, and provide high availability
access to the internet.
● Network redundancy is a process through which additional or alternate
instances of network devices, equipment and communication mediums are
installed within network infrastructure. It is a method for ensuring network
availability in case of a network device or path failure and unavailability.
● The concept of Network Redundancy is to provide alternate and efficien

Networking requirements:
1.LAN IP network design.
2.Network Topology diagram.
3.Configurations required on the routers to setup high availability with HSRP.
4.Configurations required on the routers to setup appropriate IP address and internet
packet
forwarding on the routers.
5.Configurations required on the LAN PC’s for appropriate gateway parameters.
6.Verification and Testing Procedure
Hardware:
1.Cisco routers ( 2 nos)
2.Cisco switches ( 2 nos)
3.Internet router (Internet not mandatory)
4.PC (As per requirement)
5.Network cables
